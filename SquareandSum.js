# Square(n) Sum

### 3/24/2021

Description:
Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

//my solution

function squareSum(numbers){
  let result = 0
  numbers.forEach( x => result = result + ( Math.pow(x, 2) ) )
  return result
}

## codewars solutions I like

### Using the Reduce Function

`
function squareSum(numbers){
  return numbers.reduce(function(sum, n){
    return (n*n) + sum;
  }, 0)
}
`

`
function squareSum(numbers){
  return numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator+= currentValue ** 2, 0)
}
`

  

## solutions I don't yet understand

today, I did another 100devs class. 
I think i might have a chance to still catch up but i'm feeling stretched pretty thin across a tech rehearsal week and learning Javascript and trying to get my freelance career together.
But I think I can do it.  I have to believe in myself.  I just do.
